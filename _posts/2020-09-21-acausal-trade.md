I am proud of [this article](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YBc4gNAELC3uMjPtQ/gems-from-the-wiki-acausal-trade) that I had a big part in writing, which was now chosen by LessWrong as a "gem" worthy of reposting.

I have not contributed anything new  to the concept of acausal trade, but it is the first article I know about the topic: Previously there were nothing but hints in LessWrong comments. This article has been cited a few times. There it is possibly it is still the best article on the topic.

Thanks to  Michael Vassar who explained the topic to me in 2012. That understanding inspired me to write the article
