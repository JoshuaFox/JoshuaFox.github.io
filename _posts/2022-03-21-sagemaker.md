With Michael Pelts, Senior Solutions Architect at AWS and I  explored ways to allow tenants to expose their own models for inference when ensuring that it is accessed only by the tenant that created it. 

We gave the talk online at the Australia Multicloud Engineering Meetup, then again face-to-face at the Tel Aviv location.

["Multitenant inference architecture with SageMaker endpoints"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXp1uRHNA9o).

This talk has similar content to the   article "[Implementing SaaS Tenant Isolation Using Amazon SageMaker Endpoints and IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/implementing-saas-tenant-isolation-using-amazon-sagemaker-endpoints-and-iam/)" but also gives a higher-level architecture perspective.
