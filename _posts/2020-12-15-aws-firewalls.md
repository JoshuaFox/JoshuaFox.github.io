When I saw that AWS had a new firewall with the uninformative name "Network Firewall," I thought "not another one." [This is my attempt](https://blog.doit-intl.com/aws-firewalls-101-how-and-when-to-use-each-one-d4ad8087a6b3?source=friends_link&sk=bf365adf9fba5a4119a72cd026faf1c4) to sort them all out. Then Jeff Barr, AWS Chief Evangelist, [tweeted it](https://twitter.com/jeffbarr/status/1338503955370762241)!
