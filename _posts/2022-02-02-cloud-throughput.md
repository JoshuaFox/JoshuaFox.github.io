I wrote an open-source project measuring throughput (also latency) as compared to distance between cloud regions, across clouds (GCP and AWS) or within a single cloud. From what I can tell, this is the first tool 
 - measuring *throughput* (most others focus on latency)
 - and doing so *across clouds* 
 - and relating it to *distance*.
 
[This article](https://www.doit-intl.com/throughput-metrics-across-the-clouds/)
describes the conclusions.
