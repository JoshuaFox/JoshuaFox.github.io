_Chaos Monkeys_ by Antonio García Martínez   <img style="padding:40px" align="right"  src="/img/chaosmonkeys.jpg" />  

<!--end.excerpt-->
Funny and slice-of-life from the VC-backed tech scene. Like _Silicon Valley_, but a memoir.
<blockquote>
Back in Havana, my cousins were eyeing posters of Che and Fidel on crumbling buildings and the sides of lurching, belching buses. Alongside were rousing posters, designed in that wonderfully retro socialist realism only the Cubans still embraced: ¡TODO POR LA REVOLUCIÓN! ¡HASTA LA VICTORIA SIEMPRE! ¡PATRIA O MUERTE, VENCEREMOS!
Meanwhile, I was walking around Facebook, surrounded by stenciled portraits of Mark and equally exhortatory posters: PROCEED AND BE BOLD! GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD! MAKE AN IMPACT!
At their extremes, capitalism and communism become equivalent:
Endless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader, and put into practice by a leadership caste selected for its adherence to aforementioned principles, and richly rewarded for its willingness to grind whatever human grist the mill required?
Same in both.
A (mostly) pliant media that flatters the existing system of production, framing it as the only such system possible?
Check!
Foot soldiers who sacrifice their families and personal lives for the efficient running of the system, and who view their sole human value through the prism of advancement within that system?
Welcome to the People’s Republic of Facebook.

Many execs want about loyalty in their employees. What's "loyalty"? Just that the employee hasn't quit before lunch today? That the worker isn't moonlighting as an embezzler from their day job? That's setting a low bar.

The famous Netflix corporate culture, which no one lives up to but which all of tech approaches to one degree or another, [says](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) that it's good not to quit and fire too fast, but " But unconditional allegiance... is not what we are about." In elite tech, employees quit and companies fire, layoff, or just close at lightning speed. So what's loyalty. 


See that quote above? It has been said about many other companies in their prime, whether Apple, Microsoft of the late 90's, or even IBM of the good old days.

But most execs can't aspire to a voluntary cult. "Loyalty" means the pale reflection of a cult that is the best the can hope for.
