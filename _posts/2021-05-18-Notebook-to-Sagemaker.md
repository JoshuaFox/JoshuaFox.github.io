I completed the AWS Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Black Belt, an advanced certification with  more than a multiple choice example: It requires a final project roughly at the level of a university term project. See the blog post [here](https://blog.doit-intl.com/aws-black-belt-in-machine-learning-d89651a71b32?source=friends_link&sk=4088bd1d324fb4ca4a19081f3d7538a0).
