In 1915, Max Weinreich published this article with a translation of Book 9 of the Iliad, it is available [here](https://www.epaveldas.lt/object/recordDescription/LNB/C1B0001125164), but I have converted it to PDF for easier reading

- [Article here in normal size (good for printing)](/content/Weinreich-Iliad-A4.pdf)
