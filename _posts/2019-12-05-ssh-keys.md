title: Google shuffles your SSH keys 
subtitle:
---

You try to SSH to a VM in Google Compute Engine, and get  "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!"

<!--end.excerpt-->

For your GCE, Google changes the host SSH keys on automated updates and other events. So, you'll get that "CHANGED!" warning a lot. Whether a human or an n automated script is SSH-ing to the instances, you will want to get rid of it.

Fixes: 

* Dangerous but works: Ignore the `known_hosts` SSH keys' signature with `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` . 
* Better: Let Google [manage SSH keys  for you in Metadata.](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys) GCP's IAM system keeps everything safe; you don't have to keep track yourself.
* Best: [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access) for even more automation and less key-tracking. Add a user's keys for access to all GCE instances project-wide or just to one instance.
