Cyrus Adler’s masterful _Short History of the Jewish People_ (3rd ed., 1948, p. 287) tells of Jewish “barbaric tribes and kingdoms” in the “Cimmerian Bosporus” to the north of the Black Sea. Conan came of [ Cimmerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimmeria_(Conan)) stock. Was he one of these Jewish barbarians?

The Cimmerians appear not only in Robert E. Howard’s Conan tales, but also in  Genesis 10, where the Hebrew equivalent is [Gomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomer). (The English  comes from  Greek _Kimmeroi_, Κιμμέριοι, from Akkadian Gimirri, cognate to Hebrew Gomer.)

Conan, too,  bore an ordinary  Hebrew name, that of the  Biblical Conaniahu כונניהו (II Chron 31:12-13), a Levite, and maybe a Cohen, in the Temple. The name means “God has established. “Conan” in place of Conanyahu is a hypercoristic form. Why? Could it be because of the Hebrew's idol-worshipping tendencies that had to be hidden? Ishba’al son of King Saul (I Chron. 9:39) becomes Ishboshet. So, Conan’s proper Hebrew name?   כוננכרום הגומרי, Conancrom Ha-gumri.

 John Hyrcanos, Hasmonean king of Judea, was best known for  barbaric ways of which  Conan would have approved. [Hyrcania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrcania), the eponymous kingdom south of the Caspian Sea, near the aforementioned Cimmeria, is uncoincidentally [one of those lands](http://hyboria.xoth.net/gazetteer/hyrkania.htm) trodden by Conan’s sandaled feet. But back to Conan’s taste for kreplach. The Cimmerian  region was  also  inhabited by the [Scythians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians), the probable source of the name [Ashkenaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenaz). Genesis 10:3 actually presents the two peoples as closely related: Gomer (Cimmeria) is the father of Ashkenaz (Scythia).  Seen the movie? Notice Conan's Yiddish accent?
