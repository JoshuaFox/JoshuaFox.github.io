Cyrus Adler’s masterful _Short History of the Jewish People_ (3rd ed., 1948, p. 287) tells of Jewish “barbaric tribes and kingdoms” in the “Cimmerian Bosporus” to the north of the Black Sea. Conan came of [ Cimmerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimmeria_(Conan)) stock. Was he one of these Jewish barbarians?

The Cimmerians appear not only in Robert E. Howard’s Conan tales, but also in  Genesis 10, where the Hebrew equivalent is [Gomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomer). (The English  comes from  Greek _Kimmeroi_, Κιμμέριοι, from Akkadian Gimirri, cognate to Hebrew Gomer.)

Conan, too,  bore an ordinary  Hebrew name, that of the  Biblical Conaniahu כונניהו (II Chron 31:12-13), a Levite, and maybe even a Cohen, in the Temple. The name means “God has established." The shorter “Conan” in place of Conanyahu is a hypercoristic form. Why? Could it be because of the Hebrew's idol-worshipping tendencies that had to be hidden? Ishba’al son of King Saul (I Chron. 9:39) becomes Ishboshet. So, Conan’s proper Hebrew name?   כוננכרום הגומרי, Conancrom Ha-gumri.

 John Hyrcanos, Hasmonean king of Judea, was best known for  barbaric ways of which  Conan would have approved. [Hyrcania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrcania), the eponymous kingdom south of the Caspian Sea, near the aforementioned Cimmeria, is uncoincidentally [one of those lands](https://hyboria.xoth.net/gazetteer/hyrkania.htm) trodden by Conan’s sandaled feet. 
 
But back to Conan’s taste for kreplach. If you've seen the movie, you will have noted Conan's Yiddish accent. The [Cimmerians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimmerians) were culturally  [Scythian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians), where "Scythia" is the probable source of the name [Ashkenaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenaz). Genesis 10:3 actually presents the two peoples as close relatives: Gomer (Cimmeria) is the father of Ashkenaz (Scythia). Conan is not just Jewish but also more specifically Ashkenazi. 

Read a Conan story, the first in Conan's life-journey, [in the original Yiddish here](https://joshuafox.com/yiddish/%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%9D%20%D7%A4%D6%BF%D7%A8%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%A1%D7%98%D6%BE%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%96%D7%B3%20%D7%98%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%9B%D7%98%D7%A2%D7%A8/).
